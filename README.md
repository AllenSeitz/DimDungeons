# Dimensional Dungeons
Dimensional Dungeons adds limitless procedurally generated dungeons to Minecraft! These dungeons are all placed in a single, separate dimension which can be accessed from a portal anywhere on the Overworld. (Such as in your base!) This makes the dungeons themselves renewable and it provides challenging, replayable content.

The dungeon dimension limits building and block breaking. This allows for a proper adventure mode-like experience on a survival server. For example, I can use pistons in my traps without giving the player free pistons. Obstacle courses can't be bridged over. Combat can't be trivialized by building fences around mobs. And light and darkness matter when you can't place torches!

Besides challenges in room design the dungeons are also randomly populated with enemies and worthwhile loot! Many rooms with valuable treasure chests require solving a puzzle that will test your knowledge of Minecraft game mechanics. Currently all of the builds are 'vanilla' and no modded blocks or command blocks are used. The goal is to feel vanilla-lite and to be fair to the player.

For modpack designers and server admins there is also a powerful config file which allows for customization of the block protection in the dungeon dimension and many other features. And the rooms themselves are configurable in the common config, meaning that you can remove existing rooms or add custom rooms.
