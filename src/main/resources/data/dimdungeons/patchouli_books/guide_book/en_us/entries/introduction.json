These dungeons are all placed in a single, separate dimension which can be accessed from a portal anywhere on the Overworld. This makes the dungeons themselves renewable and it provides challenging and replayable adventure-like maps."

And light and darkness matter when you can't place torches! Also, no stealing the blocks. (Unless you turn off the block protection in the server config.)"
